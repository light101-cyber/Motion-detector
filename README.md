# Motion-detector
The Python program below would detect objects moving in front of a camera, and mark the object with a blue square. A patch was added to the program to make it display a quadrant plot when the program is terminated. This plot will show the time range a moving object was within the scope of the camera(clearly showing time of entry and time of exit for every single iteration) as an Orange bar, and the  static times as whitespaces on the plot.

To maximize effectiveness of program:

1. Please use in well-lit areas.
2. Avoid areas with strong wind
3. Avoid areas with many shadows.
